<h2>Know how it spreads</h2>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVID_mobile_person_to_person.png">
<ul>
<li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
<li>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</li>
<li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</li>
<ul type="square">
<li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
<li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
</ul>
<li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Take steps to protect yourself</h2>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDmobile_07_wash.png">
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Clean your hands often</h3>
<ul><li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
<li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li></ul>

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Avoid close contact</h3>
<ul><li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
<li>Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick</li></ul>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDmobile_05_mask.png">
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Wear a facemask if you are sick</h3>
<ul><li>If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
<li>If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers</li></ul>
